This game is a functional version of chess in Java by Ikenna Okeke with help from Alexander Dollimount.<br /><br />
To run this program, download JavaChessGame.jar and JavaChessGame.bat if you are on Windows. Windows users can simply run the JavaChessGame file if the .bat file is in the same folder.<br />If you are on Linux/MacOS, navigate to the directory where the downloaded file is in the terminal (using cd), and run the jar file using the command "java -jar JavaChessGame.jar".<br /><br />
