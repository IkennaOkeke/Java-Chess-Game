# Java-Chess-Game
This game is a functional version of Chess in Java by me and my friend Alexander Dollimount.
To run this program, download JavaChessGame.jar and JavaChessGame.bat if you are on Windows. Windows users can simply run the JavaChessGame file if the .bat file is in the same folder. If you are on Linux/MacOS, navigate to the directory where the downloaded files are in the terminal (using cd), and run the jar file using the command "java -jar JavaChessGame.jar".
